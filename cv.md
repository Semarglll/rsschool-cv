### Summary
(your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).
