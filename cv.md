### Summary
I graduated in 2013 at S. Seifullin Kazakh AgroTechnical university in the department of computer engineering and software. Then I worked for several years in the field of civil engineering. As a Senior engineer of the production and technical department. Received a second higher education. And I realized that I did not want to be an civil engineer in construction. Then I decided to return to IT. I considered the vacancy of a Software testing engineer. But I realized that I can not only test, but also create code. And signed up for an RSS training.
